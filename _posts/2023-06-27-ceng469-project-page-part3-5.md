# Ceng469 Final Project: Temporal Tone Mapping for Simulating Human Visual System: Part3.5: Comparing Results

My project aims to model how the Human Visual System (HVS) adjusts to cahnges in light level. I plan to achieve this by using temporal tonemapping operators. To be more spesific, I will be modifying Reinhard's Global Operator as a rolling average between frames, both as a aritmatic and geometric average to compare the results.
