# Ceng469 Final Project: Temporal Tone Mapping for Simulating Human Visual System: Part 4: Final Remarks

My project aims to model how the Human Visual System (HVS) adjusts to cahnges in light level. I plan to achieve this by using temporal tonemapping operators. To be more spesific, I will be modifying Reinhard's Global Operator as a rolling average between frames, both as a aritmatic and geometric average to compare the results.

## Final Remarks

I really enjoyed my time with this project. Because I was implementing a relatively unique approach, most of my time was spent collecting data for possible arrangements. Also due to fact that I lacked any previous refenrence point in terms of weights, I was incentivized to render a great number of test cases. Collecting, sorting, and interpreting this volume of data, which sits at 143 GB in my hard disk, took nearly 30 hour of my time alone. This prevented me from demonstrating my technique with more unique and appealing scene compositions but in terms of scientific contribution, I believe that this was the right thing to do. 

During the project, I improved my OpenGL knowledge greatly and even put it to use to create my own little library. This means this project will benefit me in future in the field of computer graphic, both as a learning tool and as a literal tool. I also learned a lot about Temporal Tone Mapping, (and HDR in general) during my project. Hope it will also be useful to any person that will stumble on it in the future.
